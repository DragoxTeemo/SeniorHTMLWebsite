            <h1 class="title">Why This Career?</h1>
                <p>
                    I choose this career because I want to understand the complexities of the law, as well as knowing the 
                    ins and outs when it comes to politics, so I can do something when it comes to being a politician or 
                    legislator. I believe it's the only way to help people, as certain politician and legislator at the Federal
                    and State level wants to pass laws that restrict people's rights, a major example at the moment is the issue on
                    abortion.

            <h1>Will You Continue This Career?</h1>
                <p>
                    After researching this, I still want to continue this career. While there are other ways to help people, I believe
                    it's a temporary solution, being a politician or legislator is the best solution to helping people. While I'm a single
                    person, I'm at a high position of power and want to take advantage by making or passing bills so they can be 
                    acknowledged and hopefully passed to help the people.
