                Political scientists typically need to complete either a masterâ€™s or Ph.D. program to enter the occupation. 
                Applicants to a graduate program should have completed undergraduate courses in political science, writing, 
                and statistics. They also may benefit from having related work or internship experience.

        <p>
            Entry-level jobseekers can benefit from internships or volunteer work through clubs and political organizations. 
            These activities can give students a chance to apply their academic knowledge in a professional setting and to develop 
            the analytic, research, and writing skills needed for the field.
